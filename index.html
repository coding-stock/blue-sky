              <h1>About us</h1>
              <p>Blue Sky Youth Leadership Program (BS Leadership) is a community-driven initiative founded in Kigali, Rwanda, in July 2024 by two people; Kaitale Hadadi and Mulumba Sadam Kaitale with a mission to empower young leaders to create positive change in their communities. We believe that true leadership begins with knowledge, service, and collaboration.</p>
              <p>Through a blend of workshops, mentorship, debates, project-based learning, and community engagement, we equip young people with the skills, networks, and confidence they need to become impactful leaders and change-makers.</p>
               <p>We proudly collaborate and partner with schools, community organizations, and local leaders in Kigali and beyond to provide opportunities for youth to grow and thrive. Our partnerships ensure that participants not only gain knowledge but also put it into action through volunteer work, community projects, and meaningful connections with mentors and peers.</p>

                <h1>Our Journey</h1>
                <p>The journey of Blue Sky Youth Leadership Program began with a simple but powerful vision: to create spaces where young people can discover their potential and use it to transform their communities.</p>
                <p>From the very start, we invested in empowering and developing great debaters at GS APRED Ndera, helping students sharpen their communication, critical thinking, and confidence through structured debates and mentorship. This not only nurtured leadership skills but also gave young voices the courage to engage with important issues affecting society.</p>
                <p>Beyond schools, our journey has also taken us into the heart of the Ndera community, where we carried out sensitization campaigns on environmental conservation. By engaging community members in discussions and awareness activities, we inspired collective responsibility towards protecting the environment and safeguarding the future of the next generation.</p>
